They are also ecologically dominant species in Amazonian forests, for example, Steege et al. (2006) show that Lecythidaceae are the third most abundant family as calculated from a sample of 277,069 trees from across Amazonia and that Eschweilera, the genus with the most species in Lecythidaceae, is represented by more trees than is any other genus of plants in Amazonia. Lecythidaceae are found as far north as Mexico and as far south as Paraguay, but are not nearly as abundant or species rich as in the Amazon.

Species of the family possess numerous flower and fruit features that reflect adaptations for pollination and dispersal. Although all tropical plant families have such adaptations, they are especially easy to identify in this family because of the large size of the flowers and fruits and adaptations for pollination by bees and bats and dispersal by animals, the wind, and water are easily seen.

The long-term goal of this website is to provide in a single location all of the information that we and our collaborators have accumulated on the taxonomy and biology of the Brazil nut family. We will include keys to species (not yet available), web pages for the Neotropical species (all names and synonyms are in the database but all fields in the records are not yet populated), and copies of papers that have been written about the systematics, economic botany, habitats, pollination, dispersal biology, anatomy and morphology, and molecular biology of the family. One molecular study by Morton et al. (1997) has already been published and others are in progress and will be added to this site as they are published.

Knowing the names of things is said to be the first step in acquiring knowledge, and this is especially true for learning about and understanding the ecology and evolution of the living world. For example, as the names of species of the Brazil nut family become known, and information is made available about how to identify these species, more in depth studies about their distribution, pollination, dispersal, habitat preferences, and their relationships with other species such as predators become possible. Such information can then lead to an understanding of biological processes and to the designing of conservation plans for protecting Lecythidaceae and all of the other species of plants and animals that share its habitats.

All those interested in the protection of plant and animal species are, or should be, aware of the importance of systematic botany in conservation. Thus, the primary reason for this web site is to make it possible for others to know the names of species of the Brazil nut family and to learn how we and others have used this information to learn about their biological relationships. We are particularly interested in helping both governmental and non-governmental agencies to set aside forests to protect the diversity of this and other families of trees because all other organisms the forest depend upon the trees for their survival."	3	1138748400	0	"New York Botanical Garden"	"Scott A.

Within these webs, they are not only numerous but occupy a diversity of trophic levels. Currently the state of rotifer taxonomy suffers in comparison to the ecological importance of these organisms. Rotifer taxonomy in the classical sense has been characterized as incomplete and confused, while the modern concepts and techniques of molecular systematics have just begun to be applied to the phylum. Furthermore, the two styles need to be integrated if rotifer taxonomy is to be brought into the modern era. We feel that the current state of rotifer systematics is compromising the effectiveness of studies undertaken in the fields of aquatic ecology, foodwebs, ecotoxicology, and related disciplines. Until the Rotifera are better understood taxonomically and until this knowledge is more accessible to workers in related fields, these fields will suffer for the lack of certainty of the identity among their study subjects. To remedy this situation, we propose a project consisting of three main emphases, which will begin the process of providing a modern understanding of rotifer taxonomy, and will provide a stable base from which to expand our inquiries in the future: (1) development of a Rotifer Systematic Database using visualization technologies, and available via the Internet, (2) development and revision of select monogonont rotifers of the U.S., and (3) training a new generation of taxonomists while simultaneously improving our own taxonomic expertise."	3	791593200	0	"University of Texas at El Paso"	"Dr. Elizabeth Walsh"	"Unknown"	"ewalsh@miners.utep.edu"	"Unknown"	"Web site"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"Global"	7	"Rotifera"	5	"Database does not open"	1	0	0	0	""	0	0	0	0	0	30

Many rearing records are never published and so are not accessible to other entomologists.

It provides information of immediate relevance to agriculture, ecology, forestry, conservation and taxonomy.

HOSTS brings together an enormous body of information on what the world's butterfly and moth (Lepidoptera) caterpillars eat. The web-based version presented here offers a synoptic data set drawn from about 180,000 records comprising taxonomically 'cleaned' hostplant data for about 22,000 Lepidoptera species drawn from about 1600 published and manuscript sources. It is not (and cannot be) exhaustive, but it is probably the best and most comprehensive compilation of hostplant data available.

MorphoBank displays - over the web - dynamic phylogenetic matrices of morphological characters with labeled images demonstrating homology statements, and implements the data editing functions of widely used desktop programs (e.g., Mesquite, Nexus Data Editor) over the web in a password protected environment. It is an environment for virtual collaboration by teams of researchers building phylogenetic matrices with affiliated image data. MorphoBank can also draw on images in existing 2D and 3D digital libraries. 
If a scientist has images that are not deposited in other digital libraries, MorphoBank uses its database to store images (including films and CT scans) submitted by scientists, and allows contributors to label anatomical structures on the images.

Ornithologists from around the world frequent the bird collection, many of whom come to study the type-specimens of which Naturalis holds many thousand. These specimens, on which new species are based, are indispensable to ornithologists in order to decide whether a bird is new to science or not.

The more than two hundred extinct birds are another collection-highlight which raises much interest. Some specimens are unique. Naturalis is the only museum in the world to hold a Tahiti-Sandpiper Prosobonia leucoptera (Gmelin, 1789) and a specimen of Sharpe's Rail Gallirallus sharpei (B??ttikofer, 1893), to name a few.

Globally, the resulting loss of income from fisheries is estimated to be billions of dollars a year and affects many millions of people.

Few figures are available to indicate the sustainable yields that might be extracted for different reef types, current and potential yields of different reef species, how yields are affected by declining reef health and loss of productive capacity, and the value of non-extractive uses of reefs (such as tourism).

Sophisticated methods to quantify the deterioration of coral reefs have been initiated in some areas, while hardly any assessment or monitoring activities exist in others. Information from these activities is usually published in the primary scientific literature and may not be readily available or understood by a non-technical reader.

A larger body of information has been compiled in technical reports, which are generally for limited distribution. This makes it difficult for the people tasked with managing coral reefs to obtain the information needed for good management even when comprehensive information exists.

ReefBase gathers available knowledge about coral reefs into one information repository. It is intended to facilitate analyses and monitoring of coral reef health and the quality of life of reef-dependent people, and to support informed decisions about coral reef use and management.

The FEIS database contains literature reviews, taken from current English-language literature of about 900 plant species, 7 lichen species, about 100 wildlife species and 10 research project summaries, and 16 Kuchler plant communities of North America. The emphasis of each review and summary is fire and how it affects each species. Background information on taxonomy, distribution, basic biology, and ecology of each species is also included. Reviews are thoroughly documented, and each contains a complete bibliography. Managers from several land management agencies (United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service and United States Department of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service) identified the species to be included in the database. Those agencies funded the original work and continue to support maintenance and updating of the database.

Invasive plants have been introduced into the United States from other countries and have rapidly spread throughout the nation's cropland and ecological communities. These plants lack natural herbivores and parasites to limit their population size and are quickly able to dominate their new habitats. Every state has been affected by invasive species, costing the United States billions of dollars annually in agricultural losses and control measures.

Thousands of plants have been introduced into the United States, but not all of them have become aggressive invaders. Common attributes of invasive species include rapid growth, short life-cycles (the ability to germinate, grow, flower, and produce seeds rapidly), and abundant seed production. These attributes allow these plants to displace native species and disrupt the normal functioning of ecosystems. Wildlife that depends on native plants for food and shelter are also adversely affected.

Invasive plants are a threat to biodiversity and can be found in nature preserves across the world. The Florida Everglades has already lost hundreds of thousands of acres to the invasive melaleuca (Melaleuca quinquenervia), resulting in huge losses of native plant and animal biodiversity. Scientists fear that this reduction in biodiversity can lead to the homogenization of the world's flora and the extinction of many native plant species.

Herbarium collections present a unique historical record of the introduction and spread of these invasive plant species. A herbarium specimen can help determine the time and place of introduction of a non-native plant and subsequent collections can then document its diffusion. In an effort to make these data more easily accessible, The New York Botanical Garden has begun databasing its holdings of invasive plant species. The basis for inclusion of a species in our database is the Federal Noxious Weed List and/or the State List of Regulated Noxious Weeds, both published by the United States Department of Agriculture."	1	0	0	"New York Botanical Garden"	"Diedra Howson"	"NYBG Press Inquiries"	"nybgpress@nybg.org"	"Data from a range of herbaria - like a Virtual Herbarium"	"Web site, collections databases"	"ASP"	"Unknown"	"United States of America"	3	"Plantae"	4	""	1	0	0	0	""	0	0	0	0	0	30

Originally, the lands were valued principally for the commodities extracted from them, including minerals and livestock forage; today, the public also prizes them for their recreation opportunities and the natural, historical, and cultural resources they contain.  Additionally, at a time of unprecedented growth in the Western States, the public lands are one of the last guarantees of open space, a key factor in the Westâ€™s lifestyle. 
One of the BLM's highest priorities is to promote ecosystem health and one of the greatest obstacles to achieving this goal is the rapid expansion of weeds across public lands.  These invasive plants can dominate and often cause permanent damage to natural plant communities.  If not eradicated or controlled, noxious weeds will jeopardize the health of the public lands and the myriad of activities that occur on them.  However, the BLMâ€™s ability to respond effectively to the challenge of noxious weeds, depends on the adequacy of the agencyâ€™s resources.  Although in recent years the BLMâ€™s budget has increased slightly for weed management, the need to increase our efforts far exceed our current capabilities."	1	0	0	"Bureau of Land Management"	"Antonio Harris"	"Unknonw"	"antonio_harris@blm.gov"	"Data from various providers in the included states"	"Web site"	"HTML"	"Unknown"	"Alaska, California, Colorado, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Wyoming states of United States of America"	0	"All plant weed species"	4	""	1	0	0	0	""	0	0	0	0	0	30

Projects which qualify for this database attempt to eradicate or reduce the number of noxious weeds in California. The emphasis of the database is on weeds considered noxious by the California Department of Food & Agriculture or a threat to wildlands by the California Exotic Plant Pest Council. 

The California Noxious Weed Control Projects Inventory (CNWCPI) is a a part of the more comprehensive Natural Resource Projects Inventory (NRPI). In addtion to the Noxious Weeds Project, NRPI also includes the Watershed Projects Inventory (WPI) and California Environmental Resource Projects Inventory (CERPI)."	3	0	0	"California State Department of Food & Agriculture, California Interagency Noxious Weed Coordinating Committee, U.S. Bureau of Land Management; University of California-Davis"	"Steve Schoenig"	"Project Coordinator"	"sschoenig@cdfa.ca.gov"	"Unknown"	"Web site (offline)"	"Offline"	"Unknown"	"California, United States"	0	"Plant weed species"	4	"No longer on-line: data is now incorporated into the Natural Resource Projects Inventory"	1	0	0	0	""	0	0	0	0	0	30

The situation is complicated by the fact that the world is experiencing rapid changes in biodiversityâ€”even in those taxonomic groups and locations that are well described. Often, this results from increasing human activities. Demographic, cultural, political and economic factors are known to have reduced and restructured habitats, thereby altering the distribution and abundance of species. Ultimately, this can lead to changes in the chemical composition of soils, water and the atmosphere that affect the biogeochemical cycles, which regulate ecosystem functions and services. Clearly, there is a need for improving our capacity to effectively monitor and assess biodiversity change and loss.

Numerous biological databases contain data relevant to the study of biodiversity, but most of these databases are not interoperational, and few are designed to seek out related data in other publicly available databases. Furthermore, none of these biodiversity databases link to locally stored user data. The primary goal of the BioCorder project is to develop an information technology framework and infrastructure that facilitates the discovery, access, integration, and analysis of distributed phylogenetic and biodiversity data. BioCorder will also link these distributed data resources to locally stored specimen-based data, which will allow biodiversity researchers to manage data in a structured workflow environment and answer complex research questions that were once intractable.

This project builds upon NSF-funded research that has produced 1) standards for the capture, storage, and dissemination of biological collections data (e.g. MOBY) and 2) stand-alone specimen databases (e.g. Specify, Biota2, etc.) and 3) distributed specimen databases (e.g. MaNIS, Herpnet, FishNet, ORNIS, and mapstedi). Our project will use the relevant data standards to produce a local specimen database that will track specimen- based information from inception (i.e. project design), to data acquisition, analysis, and beyond. There are two key differences between our BioCorder project and its predecessors. First, our database is designed for the individual specimen-based researcher, not for entire museum collections. The second difference is that BioCorder links the user's locally stored data to distributed data such as other installations of BioCorder, formal taxonomies, checklists, molecular data, phylogenetic trees, GIS data, bibliographic data, etc. to create a biodiversity information grid.

For the specimen-based researcher, the accumulation of data, especially molecular data, is occurring so rapidly that we are challenged to maintain good records and keep up with our own progress. BioCorder will allow the user to track specimens even before they are collected via a project manager that includes target lists for collecting purposes. As specimens are acquired, they are easily tracked through the database as tasks are performed such as producing DNA extracts, PCR products, DNA sequences, etc. The local and distributed information in BioCorder can be queried from a common user interface that contains both simple search capabilities (Google-like searches) as well as complex, multilayered searches.

The development phase of this project will be restricted to a small network of laboratories in the USA and UK that have longstanding collaborative agreements in the sharing of specimen-based data. This work will have an enormous impact on the degree with which these labs can share data, coordinate data sets, perform analyses, and collectively test hypotheses. BioCorder will build upon prototypes of web-based databases that have already been developed by the PIs. Installations of the BioCorder database will form the backbone of a biodiversity information grid that will be accessible via a central data portal. This will act as a gateway to collections, data, products and resources served by the BioCorder network and third party data providers."	1	1107385200	0	"Louisiana State University"	"Mark Hafner"	"Principal Investigator"	"namark@lsu.edu"	"Data from various sources, funding from National Science Foundation"	"Data from various databases, portal building, using standards"	"LSIDs, RDFs, HTTP."

Many of these new species are of Indo-Pacific origin having reached the Mediterranean Sea through the Suez Canal: these so called \"Lessepsian\" migrants now contribute significantly to the biodiversity of the Eastern basin. With increasing attention paid to this phenomenon, invaders of other origin-notably from the tropical Atlantic realm- are now more frequently recognized as well, a result of a natural invasion through the Gibraltar straits or of introduction (accidental or intentional) by man. 

The Atlas is a guide for researchers, environmental planners and non-specialists who are interested in or likely to encounter marine species that are not native to the basin. Because of observations and records of these new and often rare species the Atlas will expand as our knowledge on the distribution and ecology increases. We believe the best way to inform you about the changing seascape is through a digital interactive format, which will enable us to quickly update information and allow instant feedback. 

The Atlas will consist of about five volumes, each written by a group of specialists in their respective field. Individual species pages are designed to stand alone as information sheets with illustrations, diagonistic features, biological information, references and a distribution map for each exotic species. The CIESM task force experts will continuously review reliable evidence of new or confirmed records thus updating and expanding the Atlas"	1	0	0	"International Commission for the Scientific Exploration of the Mediterranean Sea (CIESM)"	"Frederic Briand"	"Director General, CIESM"	"fbriand@ciesm.org"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"HTML"	"Unknown"	"Mediterranean"	6	"Fishes, Crustaceans, Decapods, Stomatopods, Molluscs"	7	"Information on this web site are only available to the member states of the Commission - outside that, a cost of 1.50 Euro per species applies"	1	0	0	0	""	0	0	0	0	0	30

You can select a specific location and calculate the number of bird species observed on BBS routes adjacent to that location. You can also obtain information on the amount of forest within a county and, as an example, the number of golden-winged warblers (Vermivora chrysoptera) counted by the BBS within or near the county. You can download the displayed data for each state. If you are a novice GIS user, a Help section provides step-by-step examples.

These records are from published, peer-reviewed scientific literature, museum records, state and regional herpetological atlases, and other confirmed and validated observations. However, sources were added state-by-state, and state sources are not standardized in their precision. Thus, currently, some of the records in the ARMI Atlas may represent assumed presence, as published in certain state or regional sources. In an effort to increase the precision of the ARMI Atlas, we have gradually begun to move towards displaying only confirmed records, and away from assumed records of presence. In the future, the ARMI Atlas we hope to make the site more interactive, including a database query option, so that users can select locations and view the species which have been documented there. 

This project began in 1999, when distribution maps and an associated database were first assembled for all amphibian species known to occur in the United States to accompany the book, \"Amphibian Declines: the Status and Conservation of United States Species\" (Lannoo, 2005; see Acknowledgements). The amphibian distribution map database was transferred to the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in 2001, under the support of ARMI. This project is now periodically updated. Records for amphibians in the ARMI Atlas are depicted with counties or sub-counties (minor civil divisions) as the mapping unit, and maps are displayed at a national or regional scale, with a few specific exceptions.

We hope AmphibiaWeb will encourage a shared vision for the study of global amphibian declines and the conservation of remaining amphibians. 

We have the ambitious goal of establishing a \"home page\" for every species of amphibian in the world. In order to accomplish this goal we encourage volunteers and specialists to help us prepare species accounts. If you have special interest in a particular species, please contact us. 

AmphibiaWeb already offers ready access to taxonomic information for recognized species of amphibian in the world. Species accounts are being added regularly by specialists and volunteers and they contain species descriptions, life history information, conservation status, literature references, photos and range maps for many species. Some species have complete accounts; others as yet have only photographs or maps. But all species can be queried for taxonomic, distributional and exact specimen data.

This transition from pelagic larvae to settled juveniles is a profoundly important time for reef fishes. During this settlement transition, which usually occurs on moonless nights, the larvae have critical decisions to make: they need to select an appropriate habitat, avoid the ubiquitous predators and change their shape and color for life on the reef. Understanding this early life history process is clearly important to understanding the population dynamics and, more broadly, the biogeography, ecology, and evolution of coral reef fishes. 

Despite its undoubted importance, this transition has not been comprehensively studied and one of the reasons this may be true is the lack of information on late-stage larvae. I have been collecting these larvae, mostly by netting at a nightlight directly over the reef but also with crest nets and other techniques for many years. In addition, I have focused my daytime collecting on what some of us call new recruits, the recently transformed juvenile fishes that suddenly appear in the morning on the reef.  

For some reason, almost all of the reef fish larvae I collect at a nightlight are late-stage larvae ready to settle onto the reef. This is not an artifact of their attraction to the light: I have towed plankton nets in the area and I get a similar size complement of larvae. In addition, other techniques to collect incoming larval fish, such as crest nets, yield the same size categories of larvae.  
   
The simplest explanation for this phenomenon is that larval fish that are ready to settle somehow maneuver themselves into on-reef currents, perhaps just by rising to the surface water layer. There has been recent research indicating that reef fish larvae are good swimmers and can actively orient towards reefs. However they manage it, almost all of the larvae I capture are around the particular settlement size range for their species. This can be very helpful in identifying larvae."	3	0	0	"Ocean Science Foundation"	"Benjamin Victor"	"Owner/Developer"	"ben@coralreeffish.com"	"Photographs and information on larval fishes"	"Photographic equipment, web site"	"HTML format pages"	"Data collection"	"Caribbean"	4	"All fishes"	2	""	1	0	0	0	""	0	0	0	0	0	30

Look closely at one lineage of a phylogeny and it dissolves into many separate lineages, and so on down to a very fine scale. There is now a great body of phylogenetic research that has provided numerous tools applicable at particular, usually fairly constrained, scales. These tools have left many phylogenetic questions unanswered. We think these questions will remain unanswered until it is possible to do analyses across multiple scales. 

We believe that the green plant lineage represents the most suitable system for such research. It is one of the oldest and most diverse branches of the tree of life, and it contains good examples of the known phylogenetic problems. Investigations on it may draw on a tradition of interdisciplinary collaborative research, facilitated by the Green Plant Phylogeny Research Coordination Group (GPPRCG or \"Deep Green\").

Many interesting questions remain to be tested in the green plants, once a better resolved phylogeny is available, such as: How many times was land colonized from the water by \"green algae?\" Where did the key adaptive features for life on land come from? How many times has multicellularity arisen in the green plants? Did multicellularity ever reverse? How many times did alternation of generations and diploid-dominant life-cycles arise? How has tempo and mode of macroevolution changed during diversification?

Our overall objective is to resolve the primary pattern of evolutionary diversification among green plants and establish a model for doing so that will be applicable to other groups of organisms with long evolutionary histories. A solid backbone based on genomic and ultrastructural data for relatively few taxa will enable the integration of previous and ongoing studies of many more taxa into a comprehensive picture of green plant phylogeny."	1	0	0	"Berkeley University"	"Unknown"	"Webmaster"	"sean@ls.berkeley.edu"	"Data from various institutions and research projects"	"Web site"	"PHP"	"Unknown"	"Global"	7	"Plantae"	4	""	1	0	0	0	""	0	0	0	0	0	30

Their morphological and chemical diversity, and ecological dominance, are paramount among life's lineages. An improved understanding of their phylogeny will not only allow the intellectual satisfaction of discovering the \"roots\" of this major component of the world's biotic diversity, but will have important practical benefits as well. A well-supported and detailed phylogenetic framework is critical to the solution of major open questions such as the evolutionary origin of multicellularity, diversification of life-history strategies, the conquest of land, the nature of the relationship between ontogeny and phylogeny, and modes of evolution at the molecular level. Addressing a phylogenetic study of this enormous scale has also necessitated improvements in data handling and analysis that have broad applicability to phylogenetic studies of other organisms. 
Considerable preliminary data were available, and we were clearly poised back in 1994 for rapid progress in this area due to recent technological, theoretical, and computational improvements. However, several obstacles remained. No mechanism existed for attacking this major effort in a cooperative, coordinated manner. Certain groups were over-studied, other groups nearly unknown. Data sets derived from different molecules and different morphological character systems rarely included the same basic taxa, thus they couldn't be compared. Current analytical software, and the concepts behind it, needed improvements to handle analyses of this size and complexity, as did data storage and retrieval software. Standards for maintaining and adding to phylogenetic data bases, both morphological and molecular, needed to be discussed and then implemented."	5	760057200	0	"Green Plant Phylogeny Research Coordination Group"	"Dr. Charles F.

Products of ACSI will include a completed taxonomy of catfishes with up-to-date identification guides, atlases, catalogues and checklists of species, phylogenetic studies of higher-level relationships among catfishes and an improved predictive classification, large samples of freshwater fishes from poorly collected regions added to permanent collections in U.S. and foreign institutions, and enhanced international communication among fish taxonomists. The project's website <http://clade.acnatsci.org/allcatfish/> and electronic mail listserver will continue after the grant period for dissemination of ACSI data and products, and provide for communication among taxonomists about research, educational and outreach opportunities.

ACSI will be authoritative and rapid because it concerns organisms of immediate interest to its many participants.

We refer to the New Guinea Binatang Research Center [ homepage ] and to [ Miller et al. (2003) ] for general background on the research programme, locations, sampling and rearing methods, collaborators, funding sources and publications. [ The Entomological Bibliography of New Guinea ] database can be useful in looking for additional published information. 

The database includes only data generated by our research, with no reference to other published or unpublished information. It is therefore highly uneven in its geographic coverage of New Guinea, so far limited mostly to the lowlands and seacoast of the northern part of Papua New Guinea (Madang, East Sepik and Sandaun Provinces) and the highland areas around the Mt. Wilhelm (Simbu Province). [ Papua New Guinea map ] 

Our studies have been limited to caterpillars feeding on slightly over 100 plant species, mostly trees and shrubs. All caterpillar - host plant combination included in the database are supported by at least five caterpillars collected feeding on the particular plant species and reared on this plant to adults in the laboratory. Note that different plant species were sampled with uneven sampling effort and no attempt has been made to standardise the data. The life history information in the database is therefore unsuitable for quantitative community and host specificity analyses; the authors could be contacted to discuss the data limitations for any specific use. 

This database is the work in progress. In particular, it includes also species with no taxonomic information available so far, as well as those with only poor quality images, in the anticipation of further progress. The database will be slowly expanding to rare species (reared as less than five individuals) and herbivorous insects other than Lepidoptera. Presently, it includes approximately 700 host plant records between 550 Lepidoptera and 110 plant species, as well as 300 caterpillar and 500 adult images (note that database search performed with no information entered in any searchable field returns the complete list of species included in the database).

With about 137,441 species known so far (see Current coverage of LepIndex), the Lepidoptera represent approximately 10% of the 1,413,000 or so known species of living organisms on this planet (Wilson, 1992). Although attempts have been made to catalogue all published Lepidoptera names (eg the Lepidopterorum Catalogus published in parts between 1911 and 1939), none of the catalogues begun in the last 100 years has been completed. When LepIndex is fully operational it will be the only comprehensive global catalogue of this ecologically and economically important group of insects available (see Current coverage of LepIndex). LepIndex will enable anyone with access to the Internet to quickly find information such as who named a butterfly or moth species and where the original description was published.

The card index on which LepIndex is based was produced by NHM taxonomists over many decades and it currently holds 290,099 cards, each with bibliographical data and other information relating to a single scientific name (genus-group, species-group, or infrasubspecific). The index (which contains about 98% of all Lepidoptera names published between 1758 and 1981, plus misspellings and misidentifications) is an internationally important resource, which until now has only been available to NHM staff and to visitors to the museum. Its scientific importance is demonstrated by the fact that several major nomenclatural catalogues have been produced from information in it. These include catalogues of world Noctuidae (Poole, 1989) and Geometridae (Scoble, 1999), Gaden Robinson's Global Taxonomic Database of Tineidae, and the six volume Generic Names of Moths of the World (Nye (1975), Fletcher (1979), Watson, Fletcher & Nye (1980), Fletcher & Nye (1982, 1984), and Nye & Fletcher (1991)), an updated electronic version of which is available.

DNA barcoding is a new technique for that uses a short DNA sequence from a standardized and agreed-upon position in the genome as a molecular diagnostic for species-level identification. DNA barcode sequences are very short relative to the entire genome and they can be obtained reasonably quickly and cheaply. The cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 mitochondrial region (COI) is emerging as the standard barcode region for almost all groups of higher animals. COI is 648 nucleotide base pairs long in most groups and is flanked by regions of conserved sequences, making it relatively easy to isolate and analyze. A growing number of studies have shown that COI sequence variability is very low (generally less than 1-2%) and that the COI sequences of even closely related species differ by several percent, making it possible to identify species with high confidence. For those groups in which COI is unable to resolve species-level differences, CBOL recommends the use of an additional gene region. In some groups, COI is not an effective barcode region and a different standard region must be identified. In all cases, DNA barcoding is based on the use of a short, standard region that enables cost-effective species identification."	4	1065132000	0	"Consortium for the Barcode of Life"	"David Schindel"	"Executive Secretary"	"schindeld@si.edu"	"Funding from sources"	"Unknown"	"Barcoding database on-line at www.barcodinglife.org"	"Creation of a public bardoced reference database, barcoding projec formation, problem solving, new technologies, researchers, education"	"130 members in 40 countries"	6	"All"	2	"Support a range of barcoding projects, including All Birds Barcoding Initiative, Fish Barcode of Life, Tephritid Barcode Initiative, Mosquito Barcode Initiative, International Network for Barcoding Invasive and PestSpecies"	1	0	0	0	""	0	0	0	0	0	30

The ZooGene database will be designed, created, managed, maintained, and distributed as part of the proposed work; the data will be integrated into the Ocean Biogeographical Information System (OBIS). Uses for and research applications of the ZooGene database include: 1) uniform standards of species' identification, 2) evaluation of the taxonomic significance of geographic variation within widespread species, 3) identification of cryptic species, 4) accurate estimation of species' diversity, 5) determination of evolutionary relationships among species, and 6) design of rapid molecularly-based species' identification protocols.

Although the idea of a register of animal names is not a new one, ZooBank grew recently out of discussions between zoologists around the world and was first proposed by 29 authors in a paper in Nature, September 2005. At the same time a dedicated discussion list was launched at http://list.afriherp.org/mailman/listinfo/zoobank-list ZooBank has received international favourable publicity in the popular and science press.

The advantages of establishing a register for animal names include increased \"visibility\" of taxonomic work, checks for Code-compliance that will be largely automated, and the completeness of the resulting ZooBank database once retrospective registration has been completed. Additional advantages are the inclusion of species descriptions, and links to images (via MorphBank) and gene sequence data (via GenBank).

Several alternative models for the registration process have been proposed, and these have been described in the ZooBank Technical Discussion Paper. These range from registration following traditional publication, to a scenario whereby the act of online registration would be enough to make names and taxonomic acts available.

As a first step in establishing a voluntary ZooBank as a proof of concept, Thomson Zoological Ltd are collaborating with ICZN by providing open-access to zoological data in their Index of Organism Names (ION) via www.zoobank.org. The full interface for adding new animal names or other data is currently being jointly developed by ICZN and Thomson, and will be available in mid-2007. It is proposed that the voluntary system should run until mid-2008 when, depending on feedback from the zoological community, mandatory registration can begin. We welcome all comments on this prototype of ZooBank and your ideas on the future of a registration system for the scientific names of animals."	1	0	0	"International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"iczn@nhm.ac.uk"	"Names of animals"	"Search mechanism"	"RSS"	"Unknown"	"Global"	7	"Animalia"	4	""	1	0	0	0	""	0	0	0	0	0	30

Although the ICTTD project and this Newsletter is focussed on ticks and tick-borne diseases affecting livestock production in the tropics, tick-borne diseases have gained enormously in notoriety in other  parts of the world, creating a global problem. 

 

For instance, more than 1100 human cases of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever have been reported in a continuing series of outbreaks which started in Turkey in 2002 constituting the largest epidemic of this disease since it was first recognized in 1944. Another striking example is the fact that acaricides for companion animals have become the major component of the market portfolio of the global animal health industry in response to the heavy toll that companion animals, in particular dogs, pay to tick-borne diseases. 

 

One of the aims of the Integrated Consortium on Ticks and Tickborne Diseases (ICTTD-3) project is to gain a better understanding of tickhost-pathogen interactions under changing climatic conditions. The complex vector-pathogen-host interrelationship is also studied using genomics tools that have now become available.

Many of these new species are of Indo-Pacific origin having reached the Mediterranean Sea through the Suez Canal: these so called \"Lessepsian\" migrants now contribute significantly to the biodiversity of the Eastern basin. With increasing attention paid to this phenomenon, invaders of other origin-notably from the tropical Atlantic realm- are now more frequently recognized as well, a result of a natural invasion through the Gibraltar straits or of introduction (accidental or intentional) by man. 

The Atlas is a guide for researchers, environmental planners and non-specialists who are interested in or likely to encounter marine species that are not native to the basin. Because of observations and records of these new and often rare species the Atlas will expand as our knowledge on the distribution and ecology increases. We believe the best way to inform you about the changing seascape is through a digital interactive format, which will enable us to quickly update information and allow instant feedback. 

The Atlas will consist of about five volumes, each written by a group of specialists in their respective field. Individual species pages are designed to stand alone as information sheets with illustrations, diagonistic features, biological information, references and a distribution map for each exotic species. The CIESM task force experts will continuously review reliable evidence of new or confirmed records thus updating and expanding the Atlas"	1	0	0	"International Commission for the Scientific Exploration of the Mediterranean Sea (CIESM)"	"Frederic Briand"	"Director General, CIESM"	"fbriand@ciesm.org"	"Unknown"	"Unknown"	"HTML"	"Unknown"	"Mediterranean"	6	"Fishes, Crustaceans, Decapods, Stomatopods, Molluscs"	7	"Information on this web site are only available to the member states of the Commission - outside that, a cost of 1.50 Euro per species applies

In 1993, an entirely new database was created in Microsoft AccessÂ® by a professional database designer, Jon Wardrop. The new database was based on the Australian National Insect Collection data dictionary provided by Tracy Harwood to ensure compatibility. Microsoft AccessÂ® is the database management system used by Agriculture Western Australia. All early data was converted to the new structure.

By May, 2007, over 140,000 specimens (90% of the collection) had been databased, mostly by contract staff Natarsha Zilm and Romolo Tassone. The use of extensive use of lookup tables, combo boxes and macro's has refined data entry to the point where up to 600 specimens can be databased per person each day. In 1996 the Australian Land Information Group gazetteer of Australian placenames was purchased and linked to the ICDB to provide automatic lookups for latitude and longitude data for Australian placenames. A loans database has also been incorporated generating a loan issue form letter and the software can print specimen labels using fields from the database. The database is set up for multi-user use over the Agency's wide area network. Provision has also been made for scanned images of specimens to be linked to database entries for 1,500 specimens.

The original objectives of MaNIS were to 1) facilitate open access to combined specimen data from a web browser, 2) enhance the value of specimen collections, 3) conserve curatorial resources, and 4) use a design paradigm that can be easily adopted by other disciplines with similar needs.  As an NSF-funded initiative, MaNIS has achieved these objectives while avoiding the need for long-term, external maintenance of the network and centralized data management.

As MaNIS faces the future, it is only through expansion of the network, both nationally and internationally, that the real impact of this collaborative effort will be maximized. Participation by other institutions is now welcome and those wishing to join have at their disposal the data standards, software and documentation that were developed for this project. All that is asked of future participants is that they make the same institutional commitment as the original collaborators â€” to maintain their repositories of high-quality specimen collections and make the accompanying data available for the benefit of all.

At the time of its inception, development of MaNIS addressed the urgent call for natural history museums to come together to build and support a biodiversity informatics infrastructure to facilitate and enhance research, education, conservation, and public health. That call has now been answered. It is hoped that continued expansion of the network will allow the preservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in all its complexity as we attempt to address the magnitude of human impacts on the Earth's ecological systems during the 21st century."	1	999295200	0	"Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, Berkeley"	"John Wieczorek"	"Programmer"	"tuco@berkeley.edu"	"National Science Foundation (funding).

Furthermore, millions of additional observational records are held in diverse data sets. ORNIS addresses the urgent call for increased access to these data across collections and databases, in an open and collaborative manner, and involves development of a suite of online software tools for data analysis and error-checking. This project, funded by the National Science Foundation, expands on existing infrastructure developed for distributed mammal (MaNIS), amphibian and reptile (HerpNet), and fish (FishNet) databases. Improved access to avian data sets will allow predictive uses to reveal patterns and processes of evolutionary and ecological phenomena that have not been apparent heretofore. In conjunction with similar infrastructures for other vertebrate groups, it also will enable detailed and synthetic knowledge of the earth's biodiversity for tracking climate change, emerging diseases (e.g., West Nile Virus), and other conservation challenges for species in the 21st century."	1	1093989600	0	"Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, Berkeley"	"Carla Cicero"	"Co-PI"	"ccicero@berkeley.edu"	"National Science Foundation (funding).

The original objectives of MaNIS were to 1) facilitate open access to combined specimen data from a web browser, 2) enhance the value of specimen collections, 3) conserve curatorial resources, and 4) use a design paradigm that can be easily adopted by other disciplines with similar needs.  As an NSF-funded initiative, MaNIS has achieved these objectives while avoiding the need for long-term, external maintenance of the network and centralized data management.

As MaNIS faces the future, it is only through expansion of the network, both nationally and internationally, that the real impact of this collaborative effort will be maximized. Participation by other institutions is now welcome and those wishing to join have at their disposal the data standards, software and documentation that were developed for this project. All that is asked of future participants is that they make the same institutional commitment as the original collaborators â€” to maintain their repositories of high-quality specimen collections and make the accompanying data available for the benefit of all.

At the time of its inception, development of MaNIS addressed the urgent call for natural history museums to come together to build and support a biodiversity informatics infrastructure to facilitate and enhance research, education, conservation, and public health. That call has now been answered. It is hoped that continued expansion of the network will allow the preservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in all its complexity as we attempt to address the magnitude of human impacts on the Earth's ecological systems during the 21st century."	1	999295200	0	"Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, Berkeley"	"John Wieczorek"	"Programmer"	"tuco@berkeley.edu"	"National Science Foundation (funding).

Furthermore, millions of additional observational records are held in diverse data sets. ORNIS addresses the urgent call for increased access to these data across collections and databases, in an open and collaborative manner, and involves development of a suite of online software tools for data analysis and error-checking. This project, funded by the National Science Foundation, expands on existing infrastructure developed for distributed mammal (MaNIS), amphibian and reptile (HerpNet), and fish (FishNet) databases. Improved access to avian data sets will allow predictive uses to reveal patterns and processes of evolutionary and ecological phenomena that have not been apparent heretofore. In conjunction with similar infrastructures for other vertebrate groups, it also will enable detailed and synthetic knowledge of the earth's biodiversity for tracking climate change, emerging diseases (e.g., West Nile Virus), and other conservation challenges for species in the 21st century."	1	1093989600	0	"Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, Berkeley"	"Carla Cicero"	"Co-PI"	"ccicero@berkeley.edu"	"National Science Foundation (funding).

Nepal's importance to world conservation is further highlighted by the international  recognition of the Himalayan Region as one of the World's top 20 hottest global biodiversity hotspots: a region for which Nepal is a major component. Like most of the Himalaya (Bhutan is the exception), much of Nepal has been greatly modified by man over the last four to five thousand years, and little of the original forest remain. Conservation is a high priority for HM Government of Nepal, both locally and internationally, and Nepal is signatory to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). The formulation and implementation of successful conservation measures depends upon accurate and well-communicated information on plant diversity. Floras (a comprehensive account of all the plants found within a country) provide the fundamental knowledge needed for this, but, unlike surrounding countries, Nepal does not have a Flora.

Evaniids develop as solitary egg predators within the egg cases (oothecae) of cockroaches (Dyctioptera: Blattaria), aulacids are parasitoids of woodboring sawflies and beetles, and gasteruptiids are predator-inquilines within the nests of solitary bees and wasps. Despite numerous fascinating biological attributes these insects have largely been neglected by the entomological community - until recently. Many problems regarding evanioid classification (especially species-level taxonomy) remain unresolved, however, and it is our hope that this catalog of information stimulates an interest in pursuing species-level revision and other research (e.g., ootheca rearing, ecological studies, and biodiversity projects). The catalog is complete for Evaniidae and Aulacidae.

There are over 4000 species of diapriids estimated to occur in the world, but less than half of these have been formally described. This estimation is based on material in the worlds major collections, most notably the Canadian National Collection in Ottawa, Canada.

The long-term goals of this project is to track and disseminate data generated from the ongoing study of these fascinating wasps.

This report highlighted that, although there were numerous studies linking changes in natural process and species with changes in regional climate, very little was known about the effects that changes in the Australasian climate system were having on our natural systems and species. It was perceived that at least part of the problem was a lack of knowledge of what datasets, relevant to the Australasian region, existed.

This prompted researchers at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the University of Melbourne and Macquarie University (with funding from the Australian Greenhouse Office) to develop a centrally located meta database that allows easy access to a wide variety of metadata from numerous sources.

The objectives of the National Ecological Meta Database are to: 

Improve our knowledge of the impacts of climate change on natural systems and species; 
Provide information on baseline data for future monitoring programs; 
Promote sharing of knowledge between regions and institutions; 
Improve the capacity of natural resource managers to adapt to climate change through improved understanding of climate-species relationships; 
Assist in the identification of climate change indicator species (climate proxies). 
Although originally developed to facilitate greater understanding of the impacts of climate change on Australia's natural systems, the database goes beyond this, and provides information relevant to all natural resource managers, researchers and policy makers.

Traditionally, activities to study and monitor exotic plants have been the domain of research scientists, biologists and other professionals within government agencies, academic institutions and museums. The increasing impact of exotics on natural habitats requires that a broader level of participation in monitoring their spread is required. Naturalists, in particular, could greatly assist by contributing to the development of a comprehensive base of information that would facilitate efforts to control or slow the spread of exotic plants.

The monitoring protocol for exotic and invasive plants has been prepared in the form of a semi-popular guide aimed at promoting the collaboration of naturalists and trail associations in the process of recording the presence, spread and impact of exotic plants on natural habitats. To promote such initiatives, the guide presents example projects of monitoring activities and provides descriptions of simple tools and techniques that can be used to record valuable information on invasive plants. The monitoring activities described are aimed not only at providing useful information on invasive plants but, as well, serving as a means of raising awareness within the naturalist communities of the impact of invasive plants on natural habitats and Canadian biodiversity. Monitoring activities are promoted as a means of initiating local actions to control the spread of invasive plants and as a way of contributing to national initiatives to reduce the impact of exotic species on native ecosystems.

When in a new environment, introduced species can compete with native ones for food or space; introduce new pests, parasites, or pathogens; and generally cause a disruption in the native environment.

The Hawaiian Islands form the most isolated archipelago in the world, with North America being its closest neighbor. Such island ecosystems are often highly susceptible to invasion by exotic species. On land in the Hawaiian Islands there are more than 4000 introduced species. Recent studies have shown that there are also more than 300 species of plants and animals introduced into coastal marine and estuarine waters. 

Through the Hawaii Biological Survey at Bishop Museum, a count of the total number of species in the Archipelago has been compiled. In 1999, the time of the last tally, there were 23,150 known species of terrestrial and aquatic algae, plants and animals, including 5047 nonindigenous species (~ 20%). The total number of marine and brackish water alien species in the Hawaiian Islands is 343, including 287 invertebrates, 24 algae, 20 fish, and 12 flowering plants.

The Bishop Museum and University of Hawaii, along with the Waikiki Aquarium, hosted a workshop and open house on May 18 and 19, 2001. The Friday workshop was by invitation; the Saturday afternoon open house was at the Waikiki Aquarium where anyone could come and learn about Hawaii's alien marine plants and animals. 

This brief guide was assembled to provide information concerning some of the most common marine alien species to people who spend time in the coastal waters of Hawaii. Some of the more recent discoveries of alien species have been made by photographers and aquarium collectors. It is hoped that when individuals observe animals not previously seen, they will bring them to the attention of the appropriate people. This guidebook is by no means comprehensive. An additional 250+ species of algae and animals are not yet included. 

The Workshop was sponsored by the Packard Foundation and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, together with the Bishop Museum and University of Hawaii.

Invasive species may consume, outcompete or hybridize with native species, resulting in the loss of native biodiversity or even alteration of ecosystem processes (e.g. Vitousek, et. al. 1997).  The invasion of coastal ecosystems by non-native species is now widely recognized and continues to take place at apparently increasing rates (Grosholz & Ruiz 1996).  Alien macrophytes have invaded local marine habitats around the world, but they have been little studied in comparison to marine animals.  Over 60 macrophyte species are believed to have invaded the Mediterranean, 28 along the Atlantic coast, 21 in New Zealand (Ribera & Boudouresque, 1995), 18 in Hawaiâ€?i (Russell, 1992), as well as invasions in Southern Australia and Brazil (Ribera & Boudouresque, 1995).  The ecological and economic impacts of most of these invasions remain unclear, but large impacts have been documented for some species.  For example, beach drift of 20,000 lbs/wk has been reported for Hypnea musciformis in coastal Maui with >50% cover estimates in places where it attached; in the Mediterranean, Caulerpa taxifolia displaced the native late successional seagrass Posidonia oceanica as the algal spread at about 50km/yr (de Villele & Verlaque, 1995; Ribera & Boudouresque, 1995; see http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/invasive)."	1	0	0	"University of Hawai'i"	"Linda Preskitt"	"Unknown"	"preskitt@hawaii.edu"	"Site maintained by the Department of Botany, University of Hawaiâ€?i at Manoa, and supported by the Bishop Museum,  National Marine Fisheries Service,  Packard Foundation, and US Fish and Wildlife Service"	"Web site"	"HTML"	"Unknown"	"Hawaii"	2	"invasive Algae"	1	""	1	0	0	0	""	0	0	0	0	0	30

Wilson and published in 1992 by the Chromatographic Society (Nottingham, U.K.). Its aim was to provide general data on all natural ecdysteroids described so far. Each data sheet contained (whenever available) spectroscopic (UV, IR, MS and NMR) and chromatographic data together with a few selected general references. As the ecdysteroid family continued to increase, a second enlarged edition was published in 1996, but the number of compounds is still growing (more than 300 compounds were described at the onset of year 2000). 
Owing to the limited number of people interested by such a Handbook, a printed version is no longer justified, and moreover the problem of updating content was a major one. This led to the idea of developing a new concept, making a proper use of modern communication tools. A decision was taken to transform the Handbook in a database made freely available on the web to anyone interested in ecdysteroids. Between that decision and the realization, more than two years have elapsed, and the project has involved several additional key contributors. First, Fr?©d?©ric Marion-Poll (INRA, Versailles) collaborated with several students (from the INA-PG, Paris) to design the general organization of the database, defining the different fields and their links. Then came the enormous work of converting the original MacIntosh data (PagemakerÂ® files) to the present \"Ecdybase\". Juraj Harmatha (Academy of Sciences, Prague) and his son Tomas mainly did this conversion. The last part of the work was the design of the web interface done by Tomas Harmatha (Cybersales, a.s.) to create data files rather similar to the data sheets of the Handbook. Owing to compatibility problems, all figures had to be redrawn (by J. H.), but in counterpart this provided an opportunity to correct several mistakes from the previous paper editions. The Ecdybase also includes data on the biological activity of ecdysteroids (when available), added by Laurence Dinan (University of Exeter, U.K.). 
The \"Ecdybase\" as presently available, is still considered by the authors as a developing resource, which can be continuously improved and extended with the help of all other ecdysonists. Forms are available for the electronic submission of additional data for new ecdysteroids or for providing more information on already known ones. 
In the future, functions will be improved and allow e.g. a search of all compounds present in a given animal or plant species. More references will be added, although we do not plan to include physiological data (especially for the most common compound, 20-hydroxyecdysone; the literature is too vast).

Each species is illustrated as colour pictures from collection specimens, and presented with all biological data available (host-plants, frequencies, distribution, behaviour). Slides of male genitalia are shown when direct identification is more difficult. The catalogue shows also photographic identification keys for all families.
Each specimen is presented with a scale bar of 1 cm (5 cm for Sphingidae and larger moths). All specimens illustrated have been caught by J. le Duchat d'Aubigny and B. Lalanne-Cassou from 1980 and 1986, unless otherwise stated.

EcoPort is a single, contiguous, communal, wiki and database on the Internet that enables individuals and institutions to pool their information and apply their separate expertise in a collective manner to give any one of us free access and permission to use the sum of what all of us know. EcoPort is very similar to WikiPedia insofar as both EcoPort and WikiPedia comes into existence, grows and are improved by individuals who write their knowledge into the communal WikiPedia database. (The differences between EcoPort and WikiPedia are explained below.)

Any member of the public can read and use any information they may find in EcoPort without having to register or log-in and free of charge while the information is used for educational and non-profit purposes â€” a condition which we describe as a 'copyleft' framework of intellectual property rights management. Contributors and authors who want to add data, write information and create knowledge, need to register to obtain passwords and to be given authorisation by the system supervisor to 'adopt' specific records in the database that they want to create and integrate with the information and knowledge similarly provided and shared by other registered authors and contributors.

The scope of the information and knowledge contained in EcoPort is determined by ecology's 'axiom of relatedness' which states that:'everything is connected to everything else'. As an attribute of the Web of Life, this axiom dictates that any system has to be understood and managed in terms of the balanced integration of all of its components. The essential, integrated nature of everything that we do and know is therefore also the central design consideration of the EcoPort system and service.

As the field of biodiversity informatics continues to grow, keeping up with the number of available specialized software tools has become almost impossible. Thus, in 2002 the original Digital Taxonomy Web site ceased to be updated, as it simply became unmanageable. In 2005 it has been downsized and entirely re-built using the fine CMSimple content management system written by Peter Harteg, while retaining its familiar, fairly hadcrafted, look-and-feel. As a result of this downsizing, only links to free software tools that include full source code (in whatever programming language) will now be available on the site, including some legacy code not found elsewhere. Links to documents and data sources will also remain available.

Digital Taxonomy intends to provide a range of links on software, methodologies, standards, data sources, and projects related to biodiversity data management, with emphasis on open source and free software tools for biodiversity informatics.

However, this website intend to be not a mere collection of links, but a place for the dissemination and exchange of useful tools among the developers of biodiversity software and the users of such software.

Currently, Digital Taxonomy provides links of over 200 open source biological software related websites. The links are split into sections covering DELTA and identification systems, databases, ecology, biogeography, morphometrics, genetics, paleontology, phylogenetics, statistical packages, interface libraries, programming languages, and software archives. There is a section providing links to biodiversity datasets, as well as direct access to both biodiversity-specific (FishBase, GenBank, EMBL, LegumeWeb, etc.) and a general purpose search engine (powered by Google). While the main purpose of these links is to provide the developers of biodiversity management software with ready access to relevant sources of data to feed into their programs, for testing and benchmarking, they can also be of value for all users of biodiversity information.

Digital Taxonomy will thus keep up with its original purpose of providing a medium for the free interchange of information among the developers of biodiversity software and biological data management, hopefully remaining a useful resource in the years to come.

By comparison, fewer and less aggressive weeds are native species. The distinction between foreign species and native species is not always clear, and it is not easy to measure the impact of those foreign or alien plants on the native vegetation.

Foreign or alien species are usually those regarded as those that have been brought to North America by human activities in the post-Columbian times, while native species had arrived by various means in pre-Columbian times. How many species have been transported from their place of nativity to North America in post-Columbian times is, of course, unknown.

Many species arrived in North America accidentally, through packing materials, hay, and animal fodder, or in the ballast of ships, while others were purposely introduced as ornamentals, for cooking, or for medicinal uses. Many of the purposely introduced species managed to escape from cultivation, and due to rapidly changing land use, managed to spread widely. This continued change in land use, coupled with the spread of population, has made it possible for invasive species to increase their range, sometimes to the extent that they crowd out native species and threaten natural habitats. Some species that are considered invasive are still commercially available and are found in many gardens across Canada. 

Some invasive species have spread to the extent that they have begun to threaten the existence of endangered native species. The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) have indicated that in Ontario, Garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) has been cited as a threat to the endangered Wood poppy (Stylophorum diphyllum) and the threatened White wood aster (Aster divaricatus). In Alberta and Saskatchewan, the endangered Slender mouse-ear-cress (Halimolobos virgata) is being threatened by the invasion of Crested wheat grass (Agropyron pectiniforme) which has reduced the habitat available for and the number of populations of the native grass species. 

In order to increase public knowledge of the dangers of invasive species, the Canadian Botanical Conservation Network has prepared a comprehensive list of Invasive Species found in Canada, including a description of each species, and control methods for small scale invasions. Though some species that are considered invasive may be beautiful, they can pose a threat to native vegetation and natural habitats, and in most cases, a native plant with many of the same characteristics may be available to replace the exotic species.

The term alien, exotic, introduced, non-native, or non-indigenous refers to those species, which have arrived in an area outside their natural range. These introductions may be deliberate such as farm animals, pets, crop plants, ornamental plants, biological control organisms, or they could be accidental or unintentional; through contaminated trade commodities and by travelling as stowaways. The term invasive explains the exponential growth of species in an area outside their natural range by competing with the native species and usually bringing changes in the ecosystem of that area. There is considerable debate over the invasive nature of the native species, which have the potential to increase their populations after the human induced disturbance of their natural habitat. It is observed that some native species prefer to grow in human-made habitat such as gardens and cultivated lands and can increase their growth. However there is much argument on the issue of considering these native species as invasive species. (Randall and Marinelli 1996). All alien species are not capable of proliferating at a higher rate, some of them may remain in the foreign area for long and do not become invasive but some of them grow at an extensive rate thus outgrowing the native species. These alien aggressive species are called alien invasive or invaders.  

Naturally each species has its own niche where it lives, moves and reproduces. Species have their means to disseminate themselves such as plants spread through seeds and animals walk or run. The area occupied by the species naturally is known as its natural range, which may or may not relate to the political or geographic boundaries of the nations. Due to natural barriers such as high mountains, oceans, large rivers and great deserts, species cannot move from one place to another naturally, which has given rise to specific and unique biota of different parts of the world. Human beings have played an important part in transferring species from one area to another. Human migration in the early days shows the intentional introduction of exotic species for fulfilling their physical and social needs. The frequency of the early introductions was low but with growing communication technologies in the past few hundred years, the transport and passage of these species have increased many folds. With the improvement in humankind's transportation technology, the travel of species across their natural boundaries has exponentially increased (Randall & Marinelli 1996) and virtually every type of ecosystem on earth is now affected by invasive species (Clout & Lowe 1996).  

Biological diversity comprising of all the life forms is important for providing a balance to the lives on earth. It sometimes becomes difficult to determine which species are useful and vital for the ecosystem, which are non-essential and which species will be most important for the future of an area. It has been recorded that the introduction of alien species has caused serious problems for native species including human beings. The Nile Perch is one such example, which was introduced into Lake Victoria, Africa. It resulted in the extinction of more than 200 endemic species by competing for food and predation. In Pakistan examples of invasive species can also be seen such as the Prosopis juliflora (mesquite) native of West Indies and Mexico, introduced for afforesting deserts in Sindh, which later on became a highly invasive species and can be seen everywhere in Pakistan.  

Today alien invasive species account for the second important reason for habitat loss worldwide. The invasion of alien species poses problems for the native biodiversity by competing for food, territory and other facilities, which result in the reduction or sometimes extinction of the native flora and fauna. This also results in the damage of habitat and ecosystems such as the fresh and marine water resources, terrestrial, deserts and other vital ecosystems. Damage can also occur in the form of health risks for plants, animals and humans and can result in economic losses for the nation. The invasion of species also brings about the issue of global homogenization. According to McNeely (1998), the biggest danger from alien species is the global homogenization of biota. The invasive species not only damage the natural ecosystems and native biodiversity, but may also become severe agricultural pests or pose danger to industries, and even human health (Randall & Marinelli 1996, O'Konnen et al., 1999). In addition to this it is difficult to estimate the risk caused by the introduction of invasive species.  

The consequences of invasion are often more dangerous than the other forms of chemical pollution where the effects of the pollution can be minimised by arresting the source of pollution where as the invasive species once introduced grow and spread at an alarming rate. The invasive species continue to proliferate and spread after being introduced, posing a more pervasive threat than chemical pollution (O'Konnen et al., 1999).  

Awareness raising about invasive species and their threats is not a common phenomenon especially in the Asia region including Pakistan. However scientist are working hard towards recognising the issue of invasive species and their impacts upon biodiversity in the world communities.  

Some major international initiatives have been taken such as the signing of conventions and treaties, which resulted in the move of global efforts towards the threats to the Earth's environment. In this connection the Earth Summit Conference was held in 1992 where161 countries of the world signed the Article 8th of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). This calls upon the parties to \"prevent the introduction of, control or eradicate those alien species, which threaten ecosystems, habitats or species.\"  "	3	0	0	"Environment & Biodiversity of Pakistan"	"Unknown"	"Webmaster"	"webmaster@iucnp.org"	"Unknown"	"Web site"	"HTML"	"Unknown"	"Pakistan"	3	"Plantae"	4	""	1	214	0	0	"Info by PiersHiggs"	0	0	0	1184901107	214	30

It is updated annually to incorporate newly published island and state records, nomenclatural and taxonomic changes, and newly described native taxa. The file does not include any synonyms or cross-referencing of names.

The Manual of the Flowering Plants of Hawai'i (Wagner et al. 1990) serves as the foundation for this checklist. A spinoff publication that distilled basic distributional information from the Manual (Imada et al. 1989) was electronically reformatted into a database format by Dr. Loyal Mehrhoff, who also added endangerment data. Walter Appleby later transferred the database to its current Microsoft Access format. Research assistant Clyde Imada currently handles the yearly updating of the checklist.

Many of the additions are garnered from the annual Bishop Museum publication series, Records of the Hawaii Biological Survey (Evenhuis & Miller 1995-), while others are gathered by scanning current botanical literature. Proposed additions or changes to the checklist are reviewed by staff botanists before inclusion. Additions of new island or state records are based on published sources supported by voucher specimens; not included are citations based on sight records or casual observations, or on unpublished checklists or manuscripts. For the same reason, pending nomenclatural or taxonomic changes or soon-to-be-described taxa are excluded.

This version is updated through October 1998 and includes 2,213 native and naturalized angiosperm taxa. Federal endangerment status designations are current up to January 1998.

The checklist summarizes in outline form the number and identities of families, genera, and species of plants known to be cultivated in the Hawaiian Islands at the beginning of the twenty-first century. It serves as a companion to A Tropical Garden Flora and includes all the families, genera, and species covered in that book and many more besides. The checklist is updated from time to time as new information becomes available, thus it will evolve and change while the book remains static.

Understanding how many families, genera, and species of plants are cultivated in the Hawaiian Islands was an essential prerequisite to writing the new book based upon In Gardens of Hawaii (Neal 1965). Early on, it became clear that in the decades since Marie Neal last revised In Gardens, thousands of new plant species had been introduced into the Islands and it would be impossible to write a single volume that described and discussed all of them adequately. A decision was reached to cover only the most commonly cultivated species in A Tropical Garden Flora, and to compile a comprehensive checklist that would include at least the bare minimum of information for all those species not covered in the book itself. This bare minimum includes the names for the plantsâ€”accepted scientific name, synonyms and misapplied scientific names (if any), common names in the languages spoken in Hawaiâ€?iâ€”and some indication of the status of each species and locations (typically botanical gardens, arboreta, or other public plant collections) where it might be found in cultivation.

The checklist can be used in a variety of ways by anyone wanting information about the plants cultivated in the Hawaiian Islands. The checklist will quickly tell you whether a particular species is known to be present in the Islands and provide the correct scientific name for it, along with other names it might be passing under. While it is intended that the information presented here be of practical value to home gardeners, horticulturists, agriculturists, foresters, nurserymen, landscapers, and botanists, many other professionals in plant sciences and the â€?green industryâ€? should find it a useful reference. From a biodiversity standpoint, this checklist provides the most comprehensive listing ever assembled of alien plant species introduced to the Hawaiian Island. Thus, those working in the disciplines of ecology, conservation, land management, and land use planning, as well as government agencies faced with issues related to alien plant species and the biological problems associated with them, will find this checklist to be a reference useful in their respective lines of research and regulation.

How many plant species are included here? The numbers are continuously changing as new information becomes available. As of December 1993, project staff had compiled a list of over 12,400 scientific and cultivar names for cultivated ferns, gymnosperms, and flowering plants grown in the Hawaiian Islands, including about 9,900 accepted names and 2,500 synonyms in over 280 families and 2,500 genera."	3	441759600	915145200	"Bishop Museum"	"Clyde T.

Major financial support for A Tropical Garden Flora was received from the Atherton Family Foundation, the Stanley Smith Horticultural Trust, and a broad base of community support in the Islands. During the latter stages of checklist compilation and name verification, funding was received from the John D. and Catherine T.

The Hawaiian Islands are no exception. In order to evaluate potential impacts and to develop control measures or management practices to deal with alien species, a basic understanding of their biology is necessary. A prerequisite to this is knowledge of the identities of the species that have invaded the region of concern.

To address this need for the nonmarine snails and slugs introduced to the Hawaiian Islands, this check list includes all the species that have been recorded as aliens in the wild in the Hawaiian Islands (22 freshwater and 62 terrestrial species). It complements the checklist of the native species, also available on this website. Together, these two checklists constitute a complete listing of the recorded land and freshwater snail and slug fauna of the archipelago.

This checklist includes all valid species-group names but also includes synonyms and nomenclaturally unavailable names if these have been used in reference to Hawaiian records. Most records are derived from the literature, including unpublished reports, manuscripts, etc., but a small number are based solely on labels associated with material housed in the Bishop Museum collections. Only those species that appear to have been released or to have escaped into the wild (whether they have subsequently become established or not) are listed. Other species that have been deliberately brought to Hawaii but never released, and species that have been brought to Hawaii either accidentally or deliberately but have been intercepted by quarantine officials, are excluded.

For each nomenclaturally available species-group name, the following information is provided: 1) date it was first recorded in the Hawaiian Islands and the basis for this record, 2) its status as currently established or not (omitted for junior synonyms, as this information is subsumed under the valid name), and 3) its natural range (also omitted for junior synonyms). Additional information is also provided in many cases.

Little attention has been paid in the literature to introduced species of snails in the Hawaiian Islands (with notable exceptions), so the date a species was first recorded may often be much more recent than when the species was in reality introduced. Similarly, there has been little recent survey work so that in many cases it is unknown whether particular species are currently established or not. Also, many of the identifications are uncertain. Please bear these limitations in mind when using information from the checklist."	3	0	0	"University of Hawaii"	"Robert H.

A major and relatively well-known component of the island faunas are the land snails, which are recognized especially for their high diversity and high levels of endemism. But they are also recognized for being under severe threat from human activities including habitat destruction and introduction of alien predators. The tree snails in the family Partulidae, for example, have been termed the \"flagships of terrestrial invertebrate conservation in the Pacific\" (Cowie & Cook, 2001) because of the recent drastic decline and extinction of many species. Many nonindigenous snail species are being introduced, replacing the native species, and leading to a homogenization of land snail faunas across the Pacific and more widely.

The land snail fauna of the Samoan archipelago is no exception. As recognized in a comprehensive nomenclatural catalog of the Samoan snails and slugs (see the list of publications of the Samoan Snail Project), developed as the first step in the present assessment of the fauna, there are (or were) 94 recognized native land snail species. Of these 94 species, 59 are endemic to the archipelago, with 34 of these 59 recorded from only single islands. The catalog also listed 18 species of nonindigenous snails and slugs, most of them widespread synanthropic species."	3	0	1115244000	"University of Hawaii"	"Robert Cowie"	"Project Leader"	"cowie@hawaii.edu"	"The Samoan Snail Project is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. DEB 9705494.

This conservation success was achieved primarily through the innovative captive propagation techniques developed by the Peregrine Fund and its predecessors. Large numbers of chicks raised in captivity and successfully released in the wild have helped increase population numbers and expand the breeding range of this noble bird. 

Peregrine Falcons that nest in northern areas migrate southward through the continents in fall, but had not been known to occur in Hawaii before the 1960's. One bird sighted several times in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park in 1961 was the first record of this species reaching Hawaii. A few others straggled to the islands in later years. These gradually became more frequent, and by the 1990's one or more Peregrine Falcons were coming to Hawaii every year. 

This table contains all the known records of Peregrine Falcon reported in Hawaii through June 1996. More than 100 records are listed, including several coming to ships at sea a few hundred miles from Hawaii. The records have been extracted from the SIGHTINGS database containing more than 50,000 records of bird observations in Hawaii. The database is maintained at Bishop Museum as part of the project Occurrence and Status of Birds in Hawaii.

It was founded in 1982, as scientists around the world became concerned that bats essential to the balance of nature and human economies were in alarming decline. Under the founding guidance of Dr. Merlin Tuttle, an internationally recognized authority on bats, the organization has achieved unprecedented progress by emphasizing sustainable uses of natural resources that benefit both bats and people. 

BCI now employs a staff of 39 biologists, educators, and administrators, supported by more than 14,000 members in 70 countries. Its pioneering accomplishments have been featured on all major news networks in the United States, international wildlife documentaries, and in numerous prestigious books, magazines, newspapers, and web sites worldwide, educating millions of people to appreciate bats as invaluable allies. 

BCI's many educational achievements include major television documentaries, such as The Secret World of Bats, and award-winning exhibits that continue to reach millions of people each year. Its publications and audiovisual programs empower thousands of BCI members and collaborators to greatly extend the organization's philosophy and mission. 

BCIâ€™s conservation efforts have resulted in permanent protection for a majority of North America's most important remaining bat caves, saved millions of bats from being accidentally buried during mine safety closures, and led to the establishment of the first national park in U.S. history to protect a tropical rain forest. BCI has sponsored research documenting the key roles of bats in major ecosystems, supported training for graduate students in 33 countries, and trained hundreds of wildlife managers from more than 12 countries in bat management and conflict avoidance techniques. 

Today, BCI is expanding its bat conservation goals, and through its growing worldwide partnerships, is multiplying the impact of every dollar invested. Eighty-six cents of each dollar raised goes directly to fund conservation, education, and research that helps bats and the ecosystems that rely on them, a higher proportion than reported by seven of Americaâ€™s 10 largest conservation organizations. 

Much remains to be done as we educate an increasingly urbanized generation to appreciate and live in harmony with the natural world. BCI has shown that bats and people can live together in harmony with great mutual benefit. Furthermore, we have reestablished millions of bats, where without timely intervention there would now be few or none. Bats are an irreplaceable and invaluable natural resource that simply must be protected. Nevertheless, they still rank among the world's most misunderstood and endangered wildlife, hence BCI's continuing mission."	5	378687600	0	"Bat Conservation International"	"Unknown"	"General Bat Info"	"batinfo@batcon.org"	"This web site has images, species profiles and a range of other information on the site"	"Web site"	"ASP"	"Unknown"	"United States of America"	3	"Chiroptera"	7	""	1	0	0	0	""	0	0	0	0	0	30

This \"webbed\" site is your portal to information on southwest, Kimberlely and arid zone frog species, conservation of WA frogs, education programmes, news and links to other sites around Australia. 

Our mission at Alcoa Frog Watch is twofold. First, research on WA frogs is a major priority for Museum staff. There is still much to be learned from our WA frogs, and the Department of Terrestrial Vertebrates (frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals) works with CALM, universities, the Perth Zoo and other collaborators to carry out research on the evolution, ecology and conservation of WA frogs. New species are still being described in WA, and many more species remain to be discovered. 

Our second mission is to educate people on all aspects of WA frogs - the kinds of species in different regions, their habitats, behaviours, threats to their survival. We have several programmes where people have an opportunity to learn about frogs. Talks by our expert froggers at the Museum's Discovery Centre cater to school and community groups and provide the best introduction to frogs. Our display of live frogs complement the demonstrations at the Museum. A series of \"Building Frog-friendly Gardens\" workshops will be conducted around the Perth and regional areas in winter and spring. See the upcoming schedule for upcoming events. Once you've built a frog pond in your back yard, it's possible to obtain tadpoles from your neighbour through our tadpole exchange programme. We're pleased to make available Dale Roberts's recordings of amazing southwest frog calls - always popular with Alcoa Frog Watchers!

More than 6,500 nonindigenous species are now established in the United States, posing risks to native species, valued ecosystems, and human and wildlife health. These invaders extract a huge cost. The current annual environmental, economic, and health-related costs of invasive species exceed those of all other natural disasters combined. 

USGS plays an important role in Federal efforts to combat invasive species in natural and semi-natural areas through early detection and assessment of newly established invaders, monitoring of invading populations; improving understanding of the ecology of invaders and factors in the resistance of habitats to invasion; and development and testing of prevention, management, and control methods. USGS invasive species research encompasses all significant groups of invasive organisms in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in all regions of the United States. Working collaboratively with partner agencies and organizations, USGS provides the tools, technology, and information supporting efforts to prevent, contain, control, and manage invasive species nationwide.

The USGS Invasive Species Program provides methodologies and information to address threats to ecological systems and native species due to the introduction and spread of invasive species. The purpose of the Five-Year Plan is to outline goals, strategies, and requirements for significantly increasing USGS efforts during fiscal years 2005 - 2009 to help Department of the Interior managers and the Nation respond more rapidly and effectively to the growing threat of invasive species in U.S. ecosystems.

As a result of abnormally abundant prey resources on Guam and the absence of natural predators and other population controls, brown Treesnake populations reached unprecedented numbers.  Snakes caused the extirpation of most of the native forest vertebrate species; thousands of power outages affecting private, commercial, and military activities; widespread loss of domestic birds and pets; and considerable emotional trauma to residents and visitors alike when snakes invaded human habitats with the potential for severe envenomation of small children.  Since Guam is a major transportation hub in the Pacific, numerous opportunities exist for the brown Treesnakes on Guam to be introduced accidentally to other Pacific islands as passive stowaways in ship and air traffic from Guam.  Numerous sightings of this species have been reported on other islands, and an incipient population is probably established on Saipan.

Cactus moth appeared in the Florida Keys in 1989, spreading as far as South Carolina and Alabama. Cactus moth quickly destroys a stand of pricklypear, and is a threat to natural biodiversity, horticulture, and forage in the southwestern United States and Mexico. 

Concerned about the potential damage caused by the cactus moth, a partnership has been formed between federal agencies (USGS BRD, USDA APHIS), state agencies (states' Departments of Agriculture), universities (Mississippi State University) Cooperative Extension Service, and other interested groups to monitor the distribution of the cactus moth. This partnership developed the Cactus Moth Detection and Monitoring Network, composed of volunteer monitors from public and private land management units, garden clubs and Master Gardeners to monitor the spread of the moth. The program relies on volunteers to monitor cactus populations and report observations. This is the first step of an Early Detection and Rapid Response (EDRR) approach. The data will be used to support modeling efforts to better predict likely locations for new pricklypear cactus and cactus moth, helping guide surveys.

The CMDMN is storing several different types of information about pricklypear cactus and the cactus moth. Some of this information is provided graphically through a GIS application. The system displays the locations of pricklypear cacti with the moth sightings included. Negative reports are also being used for modeling purposes. 

In the effort to monitor the progress of the cactus moth, sentinel sites have been established along the leading edge. These sites are monitored on a regular basis for the presence of the cactus moth.

Administratively housed at the U.S. Geological Survey Fort Collins Science Center in Colorado, the National Institute of Invasive Species Science provides a hub for invasive species science collaboration, coordination, and integration across agencies and disciplines.
 
The U.S. Geological Survey is uniquely positioned to integrate research on invasive species in support of resource management in the U.S. Department of the Interior and other land management agencies. Cooperative research programs on invasive species with NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center several DOI agencies, and state and non-government organizations provides the coordinated yet distributed infrastructure to leverage funding, data, research, results, and human resources for this challenging endeavor.
 
The mission of the National Institute of Invasive Species Science is to work with others to coordinate data and research from many sources to predict and reduce the effects of harmful non-native plants, animals, and diseases in natural areas and throughout the United States with a strategic approach to information management, research, modeling, technical assistance, and outreach.
 
Our primary focus has been a research endeaver to develop innovative prototype cyberinfrastructure technologies in support of our mission. We are a research organization, and our website(s) powered by our Global Organism Detection and Monitoring System are intended as research products supporting our own research and that of our many partners. We have conducted several past projects at the National Institute of Invasive Species Science. These projects were funded and conducted by the Institute and its partners. However, they represent only a small number of research projects underway by our many partners at this time. Data from these partner projects have been contributed to our data commons / cyberinfrastructure. Finally, we also have a few examples that we hope you find interesting.

Welcome to AVIS (Avian Information System of India), an internet-based and peer-reviewed resource devoted to Indian Birds. India is one of the 17 \"mega diverse\" countries of the world. The political boundaries of India encompass a wide range of ecozonesâ€”desert, high mountains, highlands, tropical and temperate forests, swamplands, plains, grasslands, riverine areas as well as island archipelago.

The endeavour behind this portal is to disseminate comprehensive information on various aspects of the biology of Indian Birds, encourage their observation to study their natural history and ecology, gather population and distributional data in a centralised database, and spread awareness about their conservation. The portal is developed by FOUNDATION FOR ECOLOGICAL SECURITY (FES), Anand, India. Modelled on the concept of \"citizen science\", it is aspired for ordinary citizens to participate in gathering scientific data and building this free resource on Indian Birds. We welcome you all to get involved in AVIS! You can CONTRIBUTE DATA, IMAGES, or just spread the word.

 

About IBIS (India Biodiversity Information System)

One of the fundamental issues in the conservation of biological diversity is the availability of adequate and reliable information with which to develop conservation strategies. India is an important country for bird conservation, and many efforts have been undertaken to study important and threatened bird species in the region. Much of the data and literature is archived and not easily accessible. Ongoing research and monitoring programmes will accumulate valuable data on various aspects of ecology and conservation of biodiversity. To make best use of all available data, we have developed a Web-based portal on Indian Birds (AVIS). This Information System (AVIS-IBIS) is web-based, modular and searchable, allowing users to source information on status, distribution and ecology of different bird species in the region. This system can be linked to other relevant databases and information systems. IBIS will prove to be an important tool for achieving research, conservation and education goals and will serve as a model for developing similar systems on other taxa as well. Overall, it will facilitate all users to access almost all related data and information from a single platform.

AVIS is the first portal in the IBIS Portal Series developed by FOUNDATION FOR ECOLOGICAL SECURITY (FES), Anand, India.

This website is still being developed.

Our objective was to develop innovative ways to conduct large-scale, long-term ecological monitoring in a way that was low cost, incorporated and valued the observations of fishers and divers, and also educated and engaged industry and the general community on the complexities of climate change to enable them to make considered and informed decisions.

Reeflife Survey (http://reeflifesurvey.com/) â€“ Reeflife Survey (RLS), made up of a small group of core staff and a large group of volunteer divers, collects data on fish and invertebrate species using SCUBA to conduct visual census counts as well as collecting habitat data using photo quadrats. Reeflife Survey provides Redmap with scientific data relating to marine species listed on the Redmap site and the RLS divers actively promote the project through their extensive networks.

Tasmanian public and private primary and secondary schools assisted in preparing and providing feedback for a series of educational resources, including worksheets for school children. These resources use local scientists and projects to show Tasmanian students what science is being conducted in their home state and are available for download on the Redmap website: http://www.redmap.org.au/resources/teaching-resources/

The FishCare volunteers have learnt about the Redmap project and the impacts of climate change on Tasmanianâ€™s marine ecosystem and distribute Redmap promotional material to encourage recreational fishers to take part in the Redmap project. In addition, recreational fishers have been exposed to the Redmap project by being notified in the DPIPWE Recreational Sea Fishing Guide.

The Tasmanian Seafood Industry Council (http://www.tfic.com.au/) â€“ TSIC is the peak body for the Tasmanian seafood industry. Its primary role is to promote and protect the interests of all those involved in the industry: aquaculture, processing and wild catch. Commercial fishers play a very important role in the Redmap project as fish sighting data they provide over winter can help identify whether or not particular species are breeding in Tasmanian waters rather than just moving south during the warmer months. TSICâ€™s role in the Redmap project has been in providing advice on engaging the Tasmanian seafood industry in Redmap in order to build on the commercial fisher membership within Redmap. TSIC also supports the project is other ways, for example facilitating a regular â€?Redmapâ€™ column in Fishing Today, the industry magazine distributed to all Tasmanian commercial fishers. 

TARfish (http://www.tarfish.org/) â€“ TARFish is an independent peak body representing the interests of recreational marine fishers in Tasmania. The CEO of TARfish has been a strong supporter of Redmap, promoting the project through the TARfish bulletin and providing input to Redmap on communication strategies to target recreational fishers in Tasmania.

CSIRO Centre for Marine & Atmospheric Research â€“ Research scientists at CSIRO with substantial expertise in marine climate impacts and adaptation, provided input into the content of the marine resources section of the website, as well as strategic input into the development of Redmap. CSIRO staff also play a critical role in verifying the identification of species from the photographs submitted to Redmap.

And of course, all of our logged species sighting data are provided our growing membership base of active volunteer members â€“ commercial and recreational fishers and divers. Community sighting data and photos can be viewed on the Redmap site at http://www.redmap.org.au/sightings/view/ (map of sightings) and http://www.redmap.org.au/gallery/ (photo gallery).

Additional goals are to extend the Redmap database and website capabilities to collect and store additional data about benthic marine invertebrates, mega fauna (e.g. turtles and sharks) and other species (currently the site deals mainly with fish); and to improve awareness of Redmap and â€?Redmap speciesâ€™ by printing a waterproof information ID guide about species that are extending or changing their current habitat ranges. We hope to achieve these two goals by the end of 2011. In response to many requests from interstate researchers, non-government organisations, government departments and community groups, we are also developing Redmap as a national (Australia-wide) project."	1	1675	0	0	""	0	0	0	0	0	30

The aim of this project, funded for a period of 5 years by the Belgian Belgian Development Cooperation, is the implementation of a network of databases on biodiversity information, in collaboration with several research institutions based in Central Africa (mainly Congo DRC, Rwanda and Burundi). The project is a multidisciplinary initiative involving the different departments and units of RMCA. Contacts have already made to involve other institutions in Belgium, Europe and worldwide holding information on Africa. 

The activities encompassed in this project focus on:
<ul><li>An assessment whose aim is to determine the needs of scientists from Central Africa in term of access to taxonomic and biodiversity information on Internet.</li>
<li>Help researchers from Central Africa to identify the data from collections, databases and literature that are in their possession and relevant for a on-line publication.</li>
<li>Involve scientist from Central African and RMCA in digitizing, accessing and sharing data using internationally recognized protocols and tools as those recommended by the GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) and TDWG (Taxonomic Database Working Group). The projects runs in close collaboration with the TDWG African Secretariat represented by Charles Kahindo from RD Congo. These objectives include both training and capacity building aspects.</li>

On a more global scope the project contributes to the GBIF Capacity Enhancement Programme for Developing Countries (CEPDEC). CABIN is the first building block of a larger initiative announced at the 2007 annual Meeting of TDWG called \"SABIN\" for Sub-Saharan African Biodiversity Information Network, which aims at collaboration with already existing initiative in the region and to encourage new projects and additional funding in the field. 

In this regard enthusiastic collaborators, who work on African Biodiversity related information, are welcome to contact us. We will refer to their activities on the soon coming SABIN website and discuss additional fund raising possibilities.

Published information on customary medicinal plant knowledge is scattered in different literature resources, available in heterogeneous data formats, while the knowledge is distributed among various Aboriginal communities across Australia, due to varied languages. Unfortunately, this knowledge is in danger of being lost due to loss of biodiversity, cultural impact and demise of the custodians of the ancient knowledge. To document, conserve and disseminate this knowledge, we have developed the Customary Medicinal Knowledgebase (CMKb), an integrated multidisciplinary resource.

CMKb is an online relational database for collating, disseminating, visualising and analysing initially public domain data on customary medicinal plants. The database stores information related to taxonomy, phytochemistry, biogeography, biological activities of customary medicinal plant species as well as images of individual species. Known bioactive molecules are characterized within the chemoinformatics module of CMKb, with functions available for molecular editing and visualization.

Each species in CMKb is linked to online resources such as the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS), NCBI Taxonomy, Australia's SpeciesLinks-Integrated Botanical Information System (IBIS) and Google images. The bioactive compounds are linked to the PubChem database using PubChem id.

We focus on extracting metadata (taxon, people and place names, and dates) and to enhance the searchability of those terms by using associative techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to overcome errors in the text such as those introduced through Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

The family comprises an estimated 3,000 \"good\" species in the Neotropics, 240 in Africa, 230 on Madagascar, and about 1,000 in Asia. One genus, Rhexia, is endemic in North America. The sister clade of Melastomataceae, Memecylaceae, comprises 500 species, most of them in the paleotropics. The site Melastomataceae.Net will present information on the biodiversity of these two families by providing a portal to open-access databases, starting with MEL names. MEL names is a service for accessing the ca. 13,278 names of Melastomataceae and Memecylaceae with information on recognized species, synonymous names, and literature; MEL occurrence will deliver data on distribution of species and genera.

Ectomycorrhizae are mutualistic structures formed by fungi and the roots of forest trees. They are predominantly found in the temperate and boreal climate zones but occur also in humid tropic regions, as well as in soils of poor nutrition. Without mycorrhizae, trees would not be able to take up water and minerals. Ectomycorrhizae show a wide range of anatomical diversity which represents their possible function in tree nutrition and ecology. Their anatomical data, in general, allow a quick determination and provide at the same time ecologically important information about possible functions for tree nutrition.

DEEMY is collecting descriptive data on ectomycorrhizae. The data are stored in DiversityDescriptions, a modul of the Diversity Workbench. The online output of the database offers definitions of the descriptors (characters) of ectomycorrhizae used, morphological descriptions of the ectomycorrhizae, original hand drawings and photographs as well as an interactive multi-access key. Currently, DEEMY is comprising about 320 types of ectomycorrhizae characterized by 420 often multi-state characters. It includes nearly 850 drawings of characters and 120 images of ectomycorrhizae.

The goal is
â€?   	to offer a online database system for multiple usage and therewith dissemination of expert knowledge especially by providing public access to database generated identification keys, natural language descriptions and illustrations of ectomycorrhizae
â€?   	to promote common standards on descriptive data connected with taxonomic names of ectomycorrhizae to facilitate interoperability and data exchange

Ectomycorrhizae are mutualistic structures formed by fungi and the roots of forest trees. They are predominantly found in the temperate and boreal climate zones but occur also in humid tropic regions, as well as in soils of poor nutrition. Without mycorrhizae, trees would not be able to take up water and minerals. Ectomycorrhizae show a wide range of anatomical diversity which represents their possible function in tree nutrition and ecology. Their anatomical data, in general, allow a quick determination and provide at the same time ecologically important information about possible functions for tree nutrition.

DEEMY is collecting descriptive data on ectomycorrhizae. The data are stored in DiversityDescriptions, a modul of the Diversity Workbench. The online output of the database offers definitions of the descriptors (characters) of ectomycorrhizae used, morphological descriptions of the ectomycorrhizae, original hand drawings and photographs as well as an interactive multi-access key. Currently, DEEMY is comprising about 320 types of ectomycorrhizae characterized by 420 often multi-state characters. It includes nearly 850 drawings of characters and 120 images of ectomycorrhizae.

The single search result gives you all bibliographically important information on the series: the editor(s), title in its bibliographical correct form, standardized abbreviation of the series as to cite in specimen lists of scientific papers or to add in your collection management system, the place of publication and the group(s) of organisms distributed. Additionally, the first and last number of the series as well as the corresponding year of the first and last issue are mentioned. Where preceding and / or superseding series do exist this information is linked. Images of single examplary labels are included  for 60% of the series. They are taken from material located in more than 20 public herbaria worldwide."	1	980982000	1256511600	"Botanische Staatssammlung M??nchen, SNSB IT Center"	"unknown"	"editor"	"office@bsm.mwn.de"	"see sources cited in http://www.botanischestaatssammlung.de/DatabaseClients/IndExs/About.jsp"	"see http://www.botanischestaatssammlung.de/DatabaseClients/IndExs/About.jsp and http://www.botanischestaatssammlung.de/DatabaseClients/IndExs/webservice.jsp

It is set out in the style of the Field Guide to Insects of Australia group, in that you must tag your photo with at least the family, and if known, the genus and species. There is a dedicated ID thread for unknown spiders. It is also recommended to either add your photos to the Flickr map or add tags about where the spider was found. This makes it easier for those who want to browse by taxonomic name or see what spiders occur in their area. 

To use this group you can either just browse the group pool, use the spider images sorted by family thread to look at specific groups of spiders, or look at the spiders sorted by habit thread to view spiders with similar foraging methods.

I have been a photographer for almost 20 years and have been fascinated by insects, spiders and other invertebrates for a lot longer. In February 2005, after purchasing a new digital camera, I went out into my garden to test the macro capabilities on some grass-hoppers, and it sort of snowballed from there.
I had been living on the Sunshine Coast, Southeast Queensland, Australia, from July 2001 to April 2008, and I am now based in the leafy suburb of Montrose, outer eastern Melbourne, Victoria. My original intention was to concentrate on the invertebrate (spineless) wildlife of southeast Queensland, but after the relocation to the deep south and a steadily growing collection of invertebrates from other states, I decided I should open up the field to include any insect or spider I can find anywhere in this huge country of ours.

At present, I have a collection of over 4,000 images of almost 2,000 species and I haven't even scratched the surface yet. This site has been created to share some of my photos with you and to make you aware of what exists in a world not many people take the time to explore.

This is a unique resource for fundamental research on systematics, biodiversity, and conservation management in the Azores (Portugal). It also provides an original platform for biogeographical and macroecological research in islands. 
The species database (ATLANTIS database) comprises spatial grid-based (500x500 m) presence-absence information for ca. 5000 species,  based on literature survey (dating back to the 19th Century) and also on unpublished records from recent intensive surveys in the Azores. Many species are also illustrated with images of collection and/or live specimens
"	3	1072911600	1214863200	"University of Azores"	"Paulo A. V. Borges"	"Principal Investigator"	"pborges@uac.pt"	"1)	Creation of a spatial based database - all taxonomic and incidence information dispersed in hundreds of publications is now concentrated in a SQL database that is easily accessible through a user-friendly software (ATLANTIS Tierra2.0) (see more below);
2)	Taxonomic revision â€“ several taxonomists revised the nomenclature and taxonomy of each taxonomic group. The database is organized in a way that all information (taxonomic and spatial) is linked to a document (all types of taxonomic works, but also unpublished reports) validated by a taxonomist coordinator;
3)	Conservation management - a variety of areas of information related to conservation management could be introduced and filtered in the analysis process, namely: colonization status of a species (endemic from the archipelago or from Macaronesia, native, introduced); habitat of occurrence; conservation status (IUCN status, etc.); 
4)	Predictive modelling â€“ current knowledge on biodiversity patterns and processes is yet insufficient to provide social actors and decision-makers with unquestionable models and scenarios to be used to decide conservation policies (see discussion in Whittaker et al., 2005). Moreover, surveying all the territory for all the species is an impossible task. As a consequence, we aim to model the spatial distribution and geographic responses on the species

This effort was started by the Canarian Conservation Bureau with the project BIOTA-Canarias, and resulted in the publication of a detailed list of terrestrial and marine biodiversity of the Canary Islands (Izquierdo et al, 2001, 2004; Moro et al., 2003). Later the idea was expanded to the other Macaronesian archipelagos (the Cape Verde Islands, Madeira-Selvagens and the Azores) through two INTERREG IIIB projects called ATL?‚NTICO and BIONATURA (2004-2008). As a consequence of the cooperation between the Canarian, the Azorean and the Madeira governments, three more lists of species were published recently for Cape Verde (Arechavaleta et al., 2005), Azores (Borges et al., 2005a) and Madeira -Selvagens (Borges et al., 2008). With such cooperation, that included more that 200 taxonomists, now we know that the number of unique endemic species and subspecies of terrestrial organisms (fungi, plants and animals) in these islands is estimated to be around 420 for the Azores (Borges et al., 2005a), 1 419 for Madeira (Borges et al., 2008) and 3 672 for the Canary Islands (Izquierdo et al., 2004). With such a diversity of unique species, many of them under threat (Martin et al., 2008), it was critical to develop a project to highlight such importance.

Direc?§??o Regional do Ambiente and Universidade dos A?§ores, Horta, Angra do Hero?­smo and Ponta Delgada."	"In 1998 the Government of the Canary Islands started an important project on biodiversity, Project BIOTA-Canarias . A software called ATLANTIS Tierra 2.0 was developed for biodiversity data storage. This software was written in Visual Basic, using a common database environment; it uses the SQL language to develop interrogation queries and has an easy interface with all GIS software. With this database it is possible to store detailed information about the taxonomy and georeferrenced distribution of all species on the surveyed geographical areas of interest.

In the \"Azorean Bodiversity Portal\" information is imported from SQL and is being stored and accessed via MySQL in a Linux server. "	"We think that this Portal is now covering the following objectives:
a) Providing resources for colleagues in the academia (â€?Scienceâ€?), in order to test biogeographical and macro-ecological hypothesis on island systems  Data is usually provided as shapefile for GIS software or simple as presence/absence matrix;
b) Contributing to the conservation management in the Azores by giving detailed information on the distribution of species for several stakeholders (â€?Managementâ€?).
c) Helping students in their school project and reports (â€?Educationâ€?).

d) Attracting the cooperation of many nature photographers (â€?Communicationâ€?).

ABP  future developments should include the possibility of doing queries that could generate maps of species richness in order to identify hotspots of richness, distribution patterns of exotic species, gaps in species inventories, etc. We are working to provide these facilities in the future, since they are already available in the original ATLANTIS database. As the number of experts and non-experts involved on recording new localities for the species is still scarce, we hope that the ABP could inspire new efforts to accomplish this important task."	1	0	0	0	""	0	0	0	0	0	30

TAXAMATCH combines a fast phonetic algorithm for specialised tasks (such as parallel testing, flagging high precision phonetic matches, and/or use in \"rapid\" variants of TAXAMATCH), with a modifed Edit Distance (ED) approach for detecting non-phonetic as well as phonetic errors.

The Lower Brachycera collections represent a strategic starting point for coordinating specimen-level digitization for insects housed at Swedish natural history museums. The families of Lower Brachycera include 870 species, or 15% of the Diptera fauna in Sweden, and many of these species are associated with threatened habitats and/or insect hosts. A remarkable 45% of the 172 Swedish Red List Diptera species belong to families of Lower Brachycera, which includes 33% of the families Asilidae (robber flies) and Stratiomyidae (soldier flies). Unlike other insect groups with high conservation status, biodiversity data for lower Brachycera species are rare even in non-digitized form (e.g., new species records and static distribution maps). Considering the wide range of ecology in this species and the high level of taxonomic resolution in Swedish collections, the Lower Brachycera Digitization Project represents a valuable and unique source of data for these flies with relevance to faunistic, ecological, and conservation studies as well as biodiversity initiatives."	3	1125525600	1293750000	"Swedish Natural History Museum"	"Kevin C.

The AKN is organizing observation-based bird monitoring in three fundamental ways. First, we are developing new ways to discover these data by displaying metadata in the bird monitoring data registry (BMDR). Second, we are expanding existing data schemas to organize these data through the bird monitoring data exchange (BMDE). Third, we are building the technical infrastructure to allow access to these data through a federated data grid environment. For more information follow the links below.

It is based on the data gathered by experts in various aspects of flora and fauna.

Dutch biodiversity is among the best investigated in the world. This research has resulted in numerous papers, reports and books. The Dutch Species Catalogue combines this information for the first time in history, and, in this way, it contributes to international biodiversity networks as Fauna Europaea and GBIF.

The Dutch Species Catalogue offers:

- A reliable list of the species recorded in the Netherlands 
- A comprehensive taxonomic tree of the species  
- Standardized ecological status of the species in the Netherlands  
- Sources and consulted specialists per taxon  
- Numbers of  species/names per taxonomic level 
- Continuous addition and improvement of the species data by Dutch specialists  

A large number of scientific institutions, individual experts and organisations of volunteer recorders contribute to the Dutch Species Catalogue, e.g., the National Herbarium, Fungal Biodiversity Center, National Museum of Natural History Naturalis, Zoological Museum Amsterdam, European Invertebrate Survey - the Netherlands (EIS-NL) and the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (the ministry provides information on the legal and policy status of the species.). Dozens of individual specialist are contributing as well. They often participate in one of the nongovernmental organizations that contribute to biodiversity data collecting.

Spire is a collaboration of five groups: the UMBC CSEE department, the University of Maryland MindSwap Laboratory, The University of California, Davis Division of Environmental Studies, the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab, and the NASA Goddard Space FLight Center.

Spire will develop a framework to facilitate science research and education on the semantic web, and will implement and evaluate prototype tools and applications for use in the biocomplexity and biodiversity domains. These capabilities include the ability to collaborate and convey meaning through the automatic and semi-automatic semantic annotation of web documents; to improve information retrieval using background knowledge and inference; and to extract and fuse information from multiple, heterogeneous sources in response to a query. A testbed for prototyping these capabilities will be the web portal of the National Biological Information Infrastructure. The framework will include specifications for ontologies, protocols, agents, and tools for authoring, automated ingest, and annotation. These tools will leverage collaboratively constructed ontologies to bring diverse communities together and enable community construction of scientific knowledge. Additional domain-independent, general purpose ontologies will be developed to enable metadata about the contents and structure of databases and other knowledge repositories to be expressed in emerging knowledge markup languages such as RDF and OWL. This will enable agents to both access and index the hidden web, and will also support the data mining of diverse and distributed databases.

    * For every professional naturalist who has made a positive identification of some species, there are 10,000 amateurs wondering what they have just seen. There are many books to assist in the task of identification, but most cover species of a wide geographic range -- \"Birds of America\" -- even though most species occur in smaller geographic ranges. If you are trying to identify something you have just seen, the grand book of everything is too much. Too much information can be cumbersome. For identification, a good field guide could be localized to your back yard.
    
* There are many species that look the same, and can be distinguished only by genetic analysis or by knowing where they were found. If your Field Guide contains many finches or salamanders that could not possibly be found in your back yard, it increases your chance of a misidentification. Too much information can sometimes mislead.

ZipcodeZoo.com is working toward being able to provide information about the animals of a specific area. We will succeed when you can make a list all species that might be found in any specific spot in the world, without strays that could not be found there. Ideally, such lists would be sensitive to the probability of being found in a given spot, not merely whether it might/might not be there. For migratory birds, such lists would be sensitive to the time of year as well.

This relates to ecosystem services and includes the relationship between society, economy and biodiversity. In particular, risks arising from climate change, environmental chemicals, biological invasions and pollinator loss in the context of current and future European land use patterns will be assessed.

There is an increasing number of case studies on the environmental risks subsequent to each of these impacts. This yields an improved understanding on how these act individually and affect living systems. Whereas the knowledge on how they act in concert is poor and ALARM will be the first research initiative with the critical mass needed to deal with such aspects of combined impacts and their consequences.

Risk assessments in ALARM will be hierarchical and examine a range of organisational (genes, species, ecosystems), temporal (seasonal, annual, decadal) and spatial scales (habitat, region, continent) determined by the appropriate resolution of current case studies and databases.

TDWG Biodiversity Data Networks

During the TDWG Infrastructure Project (2005-2007) a list of Biodiversity Networks was compiled.  The structure of this table was created by Ricardo Pereira.  It was designed to work with Typo3, ver 4, and was populated through a web interface. 

This DDL script will create the table (structure) for the compilation of Networks.  

The DDL and data for this table were exported 
 - as:  tx_tdwgbiodivprojects_networks_DDL.sql
        tx_tdwgbiodivprojects_networks.csv
 - on:  2015-11-24

They were produced by:
  client:  Sequel Pro version 1.0.2 build 4096 
  server:  MySQL version 5.5.44-MariaDB

The accompanying field descriptions were printed from the online documentation.
